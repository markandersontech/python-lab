# Variables
## There are three basic variable types:
## Integer, Float, and String
```
X = 5        # Integer
Y = 0.5      # Float
Z = "five"   # String
```

## The TYPE command shows the variable's type
```
print(type(X)) # Prints "<class 'int'>"
print(type(Y)) # Prints "<class 'float'>"
print(type(Z)) # Prints "<class 'str'>"
```
