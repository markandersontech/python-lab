# Python-Lab

## Comments
### All programming languages allow comments
### Single-line comments can start at the beginning of the line or anywhere in the line
```
# This is a single line comment
X = 5   # comment after command
"""
This is a
multi-line comment
"""
```

## Variables
### There are three basic variable types:
### Integer, Float, and String
```
X = 5        # Integer
Y = 0.5      # Float
Z = "five"   # String
```

### The TYPE command shows the variable's type
```
print(type(X)) # Prints "<class 'int'>"
print(type(Y)) # Prints "<class 'float'>"
print(type(Z)) # Prints "<class 'str'>"
```

## Run Python code from a file ##
Most Python programs are saved to a file.  Python files have a ".py" extension (ex: MyProg.py).
Run the program by typing the program name after python3 -- "python3 MyProg.py"
```
anderson@anderson-Thinkpad-X240:~$ python3 MyProg.py
Hello, World
anderson@anderson-Thinkpad-X240:~$
```
