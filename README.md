## Using the Python shell ##
Use the Python shell to test small bits of code.
Type "python3" at the terminal prompt to enter the shell.

```
  anderson@anderson-Thinkpad-X240:~$ python3
  Python 3.9.7 (default, Sep 10 2021, 14:59:43) 
  [GCC 11.2.0] on linux
  Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
  >>> 
  >>> x = "World"
  >>> print("Hello, "+x)
  Hello, World
  >>> 
  >>> 
```
Type "exit()" to exit the shell and return to the Linux command line.


## Run Python code from a file ##
Most Python programs are saved to a file.  Python files have a ".py" extension (ex: MyProg.py).
Run the program by typing the program name after python3 -- "python3 MyProg.py"
```
anderson@anderson-Thinkpad-X240:~$ python3 MyProg.py
Hello, World
anderson@anderson-Thinkpad-X240:~$
```
